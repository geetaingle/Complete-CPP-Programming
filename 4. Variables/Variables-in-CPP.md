# Variables in C++

A variable is a name given to a memory location


#### - Variable declaration:
It refers to the part where a variable is first declared or introduced before its first use.

#### - Variable definition:
It is a part where the variable is assigned a memory location and a value

There are three types of variables based on the scope of variables in C++:

1. Local Variables 
2. Instance Variables 
3. Static Variables


## Local Variables

A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called local variable

- These variable are created when the block in entered or the function is called and destroyed after exiting from the block or when the call returns from the function.
- The scope of these variables exists only within the block in which the variable is declared. i.e. we can access these variable only within that block.


## Instance Variables

Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any method, constructor or block.

- These variables are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed
- Unlike local variables, we may use access specifiers for instance variables. If we do not specify any access specifier then the default access specifier will be used.
- Initilisation of Instance Variable is not Mandatory.
- Instance Variable can be accessed only by creating objects.

## Static Variables

- static variables are declared using the static keyword within a class
- we can only have one copy of a static variable per class irrespective of how many objects we create.
- created at the start of program execution and destroyed automatically when execution ends
- Initialization of Static Variable is not Mandatory. Its default value is 0
- If we access the static variable like Instance variable (through an object), the compiler will show the warning message and it wonâ€™t halt the program. The compiler will replace the object name to class name automatically.
- If we access the static variable without the class name, Compiler will automatically append the class name.

        #include <iostream> 
        using namespace std; 

        class Marks { 

        public: 
            // This is a class variable
            
            static int studentNumber; 

            // These variables are instance variables. 
            // These variables are in a class and are not inside any function 
            
            int engMarks; 

        public: 
            Marks() 
            { 
                // Modify the class variable 
                ++studentNumber; 
            }; 
        }; 

        // Setting the class variable of Marks 
        
        int Marks::studentNumber = 0; 
        
        int main() 
        { 

            // first object 
            Marks obj1; 
            obj1.engMarks = 50; 

            // second object 
            Marks obj2; 
            obj2.engMarks = 80;  

            // displaying marks for first object 
            cout << "Marks for first object:\n"; 
            cout << Marks::studentNumber << endl; 
            cout << obj1.engMarks << endl;  

            // displaying marks for second object 
            cout << "Marks for second object:\n"; 
            cout << Marks::studentNumber << endl; 
            cout << obj2.engMarks << endl; 
        }
