# Introduction to C++ 

C++ was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. 


## Features & key-points:


- Middle-level language: 
    
        C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) 
        and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.).

- Machine Independent but Platform Dependent: 

        A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux wonâ€™t run on Windows), 
        however they are machine independent.
        
- Speed of execution:
    
        Newer languages have extra in-built default features such as grabage-collection, dynamic typing etc. 
        which slows down the execution of the program overall. Since there is no additional processing overhead like this
        in C++, it is blazing fast.
        
- Pointer and direct-memory access:

        It aids users to directly manipulate storage address. 
        This helps in doing low-level programming (where one might need to have explicit control on the storage of variables).
        
- Object-Oriented:
    
        Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. Large-scale applications can be built. 
        Procedural code becomes difficult to maintain as code-size grows.
        
- Compiled Language: 
        
        C++ is a compiled language, contributing to its speed.
        
        
### Applications of C++: 

- Operating Systems & Systems Programming. e.g. Linux-based OS (Ubuntu etc.)
- Browsers (Chrome & Firefox)
- Graphics & Game engines (Photoshop, Blender, Unreal-Engine)
- Database Engines (MySQL, MongoDB, Redis etc.)
- Cloud/Distributed Systems
