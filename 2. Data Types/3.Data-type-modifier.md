Data type modifiers available in C++ are: 
 
- Signed
- Unsigned
- Short
- Long

|Data Type|	Size (in bytes)	|Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| short int	| 2	|-32,768 to 32,767 |
| unsigned short int | 2| 0 to 65,535 |
| unsigned int | 4 | 0 to 4,294,967,295 |
| int | 4 | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| long int |	8 |	-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| unsigned long int |	8 |	0 to 4,294,967,295 |
| long long int |	8 |	-(2^63) to (2^63)-1 |
| unsigned long long int |	8 |	0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 |
| signed char |	1 |	-128 to 127 |
| unsigned char |	1 |	0 to 255 |
| float |	4 |	 
| double |	8	| 
| long double |	12	| 
| wchar_t |	2 or 4 |	1 wide character |

Note : Above values may vary from compiler to compiler. In the above example, we have considered GCC 32 bit.
